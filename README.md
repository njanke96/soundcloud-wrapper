# soundcloud-wrapper

A very simple wrapper for soundcloud.com providing media keys support and song
change notifications.

### How do I get it

You can download the latest release for your platform [here](https://github.com/njanke96/soundcloud-wrapper/releases).

Or you can build it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/njanke96/soundcloud-wrapper.git
cd soundcloud-wrapper
npm install
npm run build-<win32|darwin|linux>
```

### Can I see a screenshot?

Sure:

### The app only recognizes one media key press

You're probably using gnome. See: <https://github.com/headsetapp/headset-electron/issues/5>
