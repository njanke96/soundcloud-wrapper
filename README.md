# soundcloud-wrapper

A very simple wrapper for soundcloud.com providing media keys support and song
change notifications.

### How do I use it

I might configure build scripts in the future, for now:

```
git clone https://github.com/njanke96/soundcloud-wrapper.git
cd soundcloud-wrapper
npm install
npm start
```

### Can I see a screenshot?

Sure:

### The app only recognizes one media key press

You're probably using gnome. See: <https://github.com/headsetapp/headset-electron/issues/5>
